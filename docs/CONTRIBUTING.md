# CONTRIBUTING GUIDE

## Pull Request

Before you submit a pull request please adhere to the following guidelines:

create branch using the following convention:\
`<type>/<name>`

There are following types of branches:

- `feat` for branches that introduce a new feature to the codebase
- `fix` for branches that patch a bug in the codebase
- `test` for branches that add missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `docs` for branches that affect documentation only
- `refactor` for branches with code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `style` for branches that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `build` for branches that affect build components like build tool, CI pipeline, dependencies
- `chore` - for branches with miscellaneous commits e.g. modifying .gitignore
- `perf` - for branches with special `refactor` commits, that improve performance

So new feature branch will have a name e.g. `feat/create-footbar` \
You can merge your branches after getting at least one review, but remember that every new feature should be fully tested

## Before merging your branch to master please also check release guide

### When merging your branch make sure you use Squash and merge!
